#This is built directory

We build your awesome Smart Patch over here and make any commits. Please be sure that the programe here is likely to be un-stable and we prefer you to use either the master branch or from the release if you would like to have one compiled and ready to use

# smartpatch
An amazing patching server for ultrapowa and redmoon servers with an amazing slick UI for the ease of users with online server management.

You can upload the patches generated by the coc server emulator to here and include your dedicated server patch to your configuration file of the server

#How to use it?
